## Assignment 2

### Coding directions

In this second assignment we will be implementing several common sorting
algorithms but with some slight variations. As with the first assignment,
you'll use assign2.py as a starting point and complete the functions from
there. Note that for this second assignment, you'll likely want to implement
other "helper" functions that can be called from the main sorting functions you
will implment.  For example, with `quickSort()` you will likely want to
implement a separate `partition()` function. 

The exact sorting algorithms you will be implementing are: 
* bubbleSort(alist) 
* insertionSort(alist) 
* mergeSort(alist) 
* quickSort(alist)
* hybridSort(alist) 
* radixSort(alist)
